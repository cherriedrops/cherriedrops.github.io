						The experience of using this unusual, fragile, and uncontrollable object, examines our over-dependence on a technology we never fully understand. We are moving away from the orders and rules created by humans, celebrating the strangeness in objects through the image-capturing process. Everyone, any individual who seeks a meditative journey to create uncontrollable and unplannable images; or the digital natives who’d like to escape the virtual realm and investigate their surroundings, are all invited and head onto a bizarre, adventurous journey with this image-capturing device.

			It is not about capturing a moment or recording information, but to remember the moment itself. It is the experience of the photographer, the camera, and the surroundings: because that is what forms an instance in life. It is a change in the relationship between humans, functionality, and material technology.
