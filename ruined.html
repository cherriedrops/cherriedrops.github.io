						Ruins are mysterious places where the past and the present collide. The destruction in ruins always urges me to visit them, as if they had cast a spell on me. There is just too much to look at and to be discovered. When these mysterious places are redeveloped, however, it has become an interesting place to look in.
<br><br>
						Being damaged and repaired twice, St Dunstan in the East Church Garden now became a popular spot for taking photo shots and videos. The Grade I listed building doesn’t seem like a “ruin” at all. In fact, when I was talking with another lady, she thinks it just feels like a mysterious garden.
						<br><br>
						Is it still a ruin? It is. It is just not the “perfect state” of a ruin.
						<br><br>
						This ruin garden becomes merely a spot for people to relax and capture the beautiful scenery. Despite this, there are a lot of things to be notified of. The texture, the patterns, the nature - they are all part of the site. Yet people are just seeing the garden from its outward appearance. It should be explored like all the other dangerous, mysterious ruins instead of just a photography site.					</p>
