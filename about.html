				Cherrie Tong is a multi-disciplinary designer based in London. She is a creative and ambitious individual with a great passion for the creative industry, curious and craving for new knowledge.

				She believes that design should a playful process and experience for both the designer and the audience. It does not merely serves as visual appealing or usable objects, but to provide the most enjoyable experience to its user. The world of design is never moving in a linear line, but a variety of concepts intersect and collide with each other. Every brief is different. From the known to the unknown, any possibilities of methods and material which might suit the context should be experimented on.
